# Iris-Flower-type-Classifier-using-Random-Forest-Classifier

We will be building a model on the iris flower dataset, which is a very famous classification set. It comprises the sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width, and type of flowers. There are three species or classes: 
                       
                        1. Setosa 
                        2. Versicolor 
                        3. Virginia 

We will build a model to classify the type of flower.Here we are using Random Forest Classifier for the classification purpose. We are achieving the accuracy of 95.55%.

And after this we are finding the important features which plays major part in predicting the class. The following are the important features:

                        1. petal length (cm)    0.453967
                        2. petal width (cm)     0.433731
                        3. sepal length (cm)    0.090022
                        4. sepal width (cm)     0.022280
                        
And then we have visualized this using seaborn and matplotlib.
